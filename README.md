# MonomeGridToBitwig
Basic Processing/Java program which demonstrates one way to implement the [Monome Grid](https://monome.org/) as a controller for [Bitwig](https://www.bitwig.com/) through [Moss OSC Script](http://www.mossgrabers.de/Software/Bitwig/Bitwig.html)



_probably can be optimised, but until OSC is natively implemented in BitWig, this works..._
